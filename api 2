API
If you'd like to deal damage to the health component directly you can call the Damage method. This method is overloaded which allows for many different damage options. ImmediateDeath will kill the object immediately. The object can be healed with the Heal method.

using UnityEngine;
using Opsive.UltimateCharacterController.Traits;
public class MyObject : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Tooltip("The character that has the health component.")]
    [SerializeField] protected GameObject m_Character;
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Damages and heals the character.
    /// </summary>
    private void Start()
    {
        var health = m_Character.GetComponent<Health>();
        // Cause 10 damage to the character.
        health.Damage(10);
        // Heal the character by 10.
        health.Heal(10);
        // Kill the character.
        health.ImmediateDeath();
    }
}
